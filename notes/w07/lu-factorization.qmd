## Introduction

LU Factorization (or LU Decomposition) is a powerful technique in linear algebra for breaking down a matrix $A$ into the product of a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$. This factorization is commonly used for solving linear systems, computing determinants, and inverting matrices. This note explores LU Factorization's definition, properties, computation, and applications.

## Definition and Decomposition

For a square matrix $A$, LU Factorization is given by:

$$
A = LU
$$

where:

- $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal.
- $U$ is an upper triangular matrix.

If $A$ cannot be decomposed directly, **partial pivoting** may be applied, resulting in:

$$
PA = LU
$$

where $P$ is a permutation matrix that records row exchanges.

## Conditions for LU Factorization

LU Factorization is valid when:

1. **Matrix is Square**: $A$ must be a square matrix.
2. **Non-Singular Leading Submatrices**: Each leading principal submatrix (upper-left submatrix) of $A$ must be non-singular.

When these conditions are not met, row pivoting enables decomposition.

## Factorization Process

To factorize $A$ into $L$ and $U$:

1. **Eliminate Elements**: Perform row operations to create zeros below the main diagonal of $U$.
2. **Store Multipliers**: Record the multipliers in $L$.

### Example

Given a $3 \times 3$ matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 & 1 \\ 4 & 7 & -1 \\ -2 & 3 & 5 \end{pmatrix}
$$

1. Transform $A$ into $U$ using row operations.
2. Record elimination factors in $L$.
3. The result satisfies $A = LU$.

## Solving Systems with LU Factorization

LU Factorization allows us to solve $Ax = b$ by breaking it down into two simpler systems:

1. **Solve $Ly = b$**: Use forward substitution, as $L$ is lower triangular.
2. **Solve $Ux = y$**: Use back substitution with $U$ as an upper triangular matrix.

### Efficiency

This approach reduces computation time, especially when solving multiple systems with the same $A$ but different $b$ vectors, as the factorization needs to be computed only once.

## Pivoting and Permutation

In cases where $A$ has zeros or small values on the diagonal, **partial pivoting** improves numerical stability by reordering rows to place a larger element on the diagonal:

$$
PA = LU
$$

where $P$ is a permutation matrix that tracks row exchanges.

## Advantages of LU Factorization

- **Efficient Linear System Solving**: Faster than Gaussian elimination for repeated systems.
- **Determinant Computation**: The determinant of $A$ is the product of the diagonal elements of $U$.
- **Matrix Inversion**: LU Factorization simplifies inversion by inverting $L$ and $U$ separately.

## Applications of LU Factorization

LU Factorization is widely used across various fields due to its computational efficiency:

- **Numerical Linear Algebra**: Fundamental for solving linear systems.
- **Optimization**: Integral in algorithms that rely on matrix decompositions.
- **Computer Graphics**: Enables transformations and projections.
- **Scientific Computing**: Common in simulations and solving differential equations.

## Example Problem

**Problem:** For the matrix

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & -7 & -2 \\ -3 & 5 & 1 \\ 6 & -4 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

1. **Factorize $A$ into $L$ and $U$**.
2. **Solve $Ax = b$** for $b = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$.

### Solution Steps

1. Perform row operations to decompose $A$ into $L$ and $U$.
2. Solve $Ly = b$ via forward substitution.
3. Solve $Ux = y$ via back substitution.

## Conclusion

LU Factorization is an essential tool in linear algebra, providing a simplified method to solve linear systems efficiently. By breaking matrices into triangular forms, it reduces computational complexity and lays the groundwork for more advanced numerical techniques.
