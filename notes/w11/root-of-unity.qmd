## **Overview**

A **root of unity** is a complex number that, when raised to a specific positive integer power $n$, equals 1. These roots are central in number theory, algebra, and applications such as [**Fourier transforms**](./fourier-transform.html).

## **Definition**

A complex number $z$ is an $n$-th root of unity if:

$$
z^n = 1
$$

The $n$-th roots of unity are given by:

$$
z_k = e^{2\pi i k / n} = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)
$$

for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$.

### **Key Properties**

1. **Number of Roots**: There are exactly $n$ distinct $n$-th roots of unity.
2. **Symmetry**: The roots are evenly distributed on the unit circle in the complex plane.
3. **Primitive Roots**: A root $z_k$ is **primitive** if it generates all $n$-th roots of unity under repeated multiplication. This happens when $\gcd(k, n) = 1$.
4. **Sum of Roots**: The sum of all $n$-th roots of unity is zero:
   $$
   \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} z_k = 0
   $$

## **Examples**

1. **2nd Roots of Unity ($n=2$)**:

   $$
   z_0 = 1, \quad z_1 = -1
   $$

2. **3rd Roots of Unity ($n=3$)**:

   $$
   z_0 = 1, \quad z_1 = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \quad z_2 = e^{4\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   $$

3. **4th Roots of Unity ($n=4$)**:
   $$
   z_0 = 1, \quad z_1 = i, \quad z_2 = -1, \quad z_3 = -i
   $$

These roots divide the unit circle into equal parts.

## **Applications**

1. **Fourier Transform**: Roots of unity are used to compute discrete Fourier transforms, enabling efficient signal processing.
2. **Cyclotomic Polynomials**: These polynomials, defined by the roots of unity, are used in number theory and field theory.
3. **Algebraic Equations**: Roots of unity help solve polynomial equations like $x^n - 1 = 0$.

## **Visual Representation**

The roots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, at equal angular intervals of $\frac{2\pi}{n}$ radians. Each root corresponds to a rotation by $\frac{2\pi k}{n}$.

## **Conclusion**

Roots of unity provide a geometric and algebraic foundation for understanding complex numbers and their properties. Their applications extend across mathematics, engineering, and physics, making them a powerful concept to explore.
