**Fixed-Point Iteration** is a simple numerical method used to solve equations of the form $x = g(x)$. The method is based on the idea that a root of the equation $f(x) = 0$ can be found by rewriting it as $x = g(x)$, and then iterating the function $g(x)$ until the sequence of values converges to a solution.

## The Fixed-Point Iteration Formula

The fixed-point iteration method involves the recursive formula:

$$
x_{k+1} = g(x_k)
$$

Here, $x_k$ is the $k$-th approximation of the root, and $g(x)$ is a function chosen such that the equation $x = g(x)$ has the same solution as $f(x) = 0$. The sequence $x_k$ is expected to converge to the fixed point $x^*$, where $x^* = g(x^*)$.

### Convergence Criteria

For fixed-point iteration to converge, certain conditions must be met:

1. **The function $g(x)$ must be continuous** in the interval around the fixed point.
2. **The derivative $g'(x)$** must satisfy the following condition for convergence at the fixed point $x^*$:

$$
|g'(x^*)| < 1
$$

If $|g'(x^*)| \geq 1$, the iteration may not converge.

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Choose an initial guess $x_0$.
2. Apply the recursive formula:

$$
x_{k+1} = g(x_k)
$$

3. Repeat the iteration until the difference between successive approximations is sufficiently small (i.e., $|x_{k+1} - x_k| < \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a small tolerance value).

4. The value of $x_k$ is the approximate solution to the equation.

### Example

Let's go through an example where we solve the equation $x^2 - 2 = 0$, which has a solution at $x = \sqrt{2}$. We can rewrite this equation in the form $x = g(x)$ as:

$$
g(x) = \frac{2}{x}
$$

1. **Initial guess**: Let $x_0 = 1.5$.

2. **First iteration**: Using the recursive formula $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$:

$$
x_1 = g(x_0) = \frac{2}{1.5} = 1.3333
$$

3. **Second iteration**:

$$
x_2 = g(x_1) = \frac{2}{1.3333} = 1.5
$$

4. **Third iteration**:

$$
x_3 = g(x_2) = \frac{2}{1.5} = 1.3333
$$

In this case, the iterations quickly begin to oscillate around the solution. Further iterations will converge to $\sqrt{2}$, depending on the tolerance value.

### Convergence and Stability

The method converges when the derivative $|g'(x^*)| < 1$, ensuring that the successive values get closer to the actual solution. If $|g'(x)| > 1$ near the fixed point, the iterations may diverge, oscillate, or converge very slowly.

### Acceleration Techniques

1. **Aitken's $\Delta^2$-Process**: This method accelerates convergence by extrapolating the sequence of approximations.
2. **Relaxation Methods**: Modifying the iterative formula to include a relaxation parameter $\lambda$, such as in **under-relaxation** and **over-relaxation**, to speed up convergence:

$$
x_{k+1} = (1 - \lambda)x_k + \lambda g(x_k)
$$

Where $\lambda \in (0,1)$ for under-relaxation and $\lambda > 1$ for over-relaxation.

### Applications of Fixed-Point Iteration

- **Root-Finding**: It is commonly used to find roots of non-linear equations.
- **Dynamical Systems**: Fixed-point iterations are used to model and analyze the behavior of dynamical systems that stabilize at an equilibrium point.
- **Optimization**: In optimization problems, fixed-point methods can help solve systems of equations that arise from optimization constraints.

### Advantages of Fixed-Point Iteration

- **Simple Implementation**: The method is easy to implement and requires only basic operations.
- **Applicable to Various Problems**: It can be applied to a wide range of equations and is useful in many scientific and engineering applications.

### Limitations of Fixed-Point Iteration

1. **Slow Convergence**: Fixed-point iteration may converge slowly, especially if the function $g(x)$ is poorly chosen.
2. **Sensitive to Initial Guess**: The success and speed of convergence depend heavily on the choice of the initial guess. A poor initial guess can lead to divergence.

3. **Not Always Convergent**: If $|g'(x)| \geq 1$, the method may not converge to a solution, and alternative methods like **Newtonâ€™s Method** or **Bisection Method** may be preferred.

### Conclusion

Fixed-point iteration is a fundamental and simple numerical method for finding roots of equations. However, it is essential to ensure the proper choice of function $g(x)$ and initial guess to ensure convergence. While it is not always the fastest method, its simplicity makes it a good starting point for solving non-linear equations.
