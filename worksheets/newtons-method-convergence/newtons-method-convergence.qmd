## **Fixed-Point Iteration Convergence Theorem**

_Theorem 1.6 (p. 35)_

Assume that $g$ is continuously differentiable, that $g(r) = r$, and that $S = |g'(r)| < 1$. Then Fixed-Point Iteration converges linearly with rate $S$ to the fixed point $r$ for initial guesses sufficiently close to $r$.

### **Proof**

Let $x_i$ denote the iterate at step $i$. According to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a number $c_i$ between $x_i$ and $r$ such that

$$
x_{i+1} - r = g'(c_i)(x_i - r)
$$

where we have substituted $x_{i+1} = g(x_i)$ and $r = g(r)$. Defining $e_i = |x_i - r|$, (1.9) can be written as

$$
e_{i+1} = |g'(c_i)|e_i
$$

If $S = |g'(r)|$ is less than one, then by the continuity of $g'$, there is a small neighborhood around $r$ for which $|g'(x)| < (S + 1)/2$, slightly larger than $S$, but still less than one. If $x_i$ happens to lie in this neighborhood, then $c_i$ does, too (it is trapped between $x_i$ and $r$), and so

$$
e_{i+1} \leq \frac{S + 1}{2} e_i
$$

Thus, the error decreases by a factor of $(S + 1)/2$ or better on this and every future step. That means $\lim_{i \to \infty} x_i = r$, and taking the limit of (1.10) yields

$$
\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i} = \lim_{i \to \infty} |g'(c_i)| = |g'(r)| = S
$$

## **Newton's Method Convergence Theorem**

_Theorem 1.11 (p. 53)_

Let $f$ be twice continuously differentiable and $f(r) = 0$. If $f'(r) \neq 0$, then Newton’s Method is locally and quadratically convergent to $r$. The error $e_i$ at step $i$ satisfies:

$$
\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = M
$$

where

$$
M = \left| \frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)} \right|
$$

## **Proof**

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## **1. Show $g'(r) = 0$:**

Newton’s Method is

$$
x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}
$$

This has the form of Fixed-Point Iteration (i.e., $x_{i+1} = g(x_i)$), where

$$
g(x) = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}
$$

Show that $g'(r) = 0$.

What does this imply about the convergence of Newton’s Method? _(Hint: see Theorem 1.6)_

## **2. First two terms of the Taylor series for $f(r)$:**

To complete our proof, we need to show that

$$
\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \left| \frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)} \right|
$$

Begin by writing out the first **two** terms of the Taylor series for $f(r)$ centered at $x_i$, along with the remainder term (see p. 21, with $x = r$, $x_0 = x_i$, and $c = c_i$).

## **3. Manipulate result:**

Manipulate your result so it looks like this _(note: the LHS of this equation is the RHS of Newton’s Method)_:

$$
x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = r + \frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2
$$
