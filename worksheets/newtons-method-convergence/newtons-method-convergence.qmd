## **Fixed-Point Iteration Convergence Theorem**

_Theorem 1.6 (p. 35)_

Assume that $g$ is continuously differentiable, $g(r) = r$, and $S = |g'(r)| < 1$. Under these conditions, Fixed-Point Iteration converges linearly with rate $S$ to the fixed point $r$ for initial guesses sufficiently close to $r$.

### **Proof**

Let $x_i$ represent the $i$-th iteration. By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some $c_i$ between $x_i$ and $r$ such that:

$$
x_{i+1} - r = g'(c_i)(x_i - r)
$$

Here, we substitute $x_{i+1} = g(x_i)$ and $r = g(r)$. Defining the error $e_i = |x_i - r|$, this equation can be rewritten as:

$$
e_{i+1} = |g'(c_i)|e_i
$$

If $S = |g'(r)|$ is less than one, the continuity of $g'$ ensures that there exists a small neighborhood around $r$ where $|g'(x)| < (S + 1)/2$. This value is slightly larger than $S$, but still less than one. If $x_i$ lies within this neighborhood, then $c_i$, being between $x_i$ and $r$, also lies within this neighborhood. Consequently:

$$
e_{i+1} \leq \frac{S + 1}{2} e_i
$$

This inequality shows that the error decreases by at least a factor of $(S + 1)/2$ on this and every subsequent step. As a result, $\lim_{i \to \infty} x_i = r$. Furthermore, taking the limit of the ratio of consecutive errors yields:

$$
\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i} = \lim_{i \to \infty} |g'(c_i)| = |g'(r)| = S
$$

This establishes that the iteration converges linearly with rate $S$.

## **Newton's Method Convergence Theorem**

_Theorem 1.11 (p. 53)_

Let $f$ be twice continuously differentiable and $f(r) = 0$. If $f'(r) \neq 0$, then Newton’s Method is locally and quadratically convergent to $r$. The error $e_i$ at step $i$ satisfies:

$$
\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = M
$$

where

$$
M = \left| \frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)} \right|
$$

## **Proof**

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## **1. Show $g'(r) = 0$:**

Newton’s Method is

$$
x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}
$$

This has the form of Fixed-Point Iteration (i.e., $x_{i+1} = g(x_i)$), where

$$
g(x) = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}
$$

Show that $g'(r) = 0$.

What does this imply about the convergence of Newton’s Method? _(Hint: see Theorem 1.6)_

## **Answer**

Newton’s Method is given by the iteration formula:

$$
x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}
$$

This can be expressed in the form of Fixed-Point Iteration by defining:

$$
g(x) = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}
$$

Therefore, the iteration becomes:

$$
x_{i+1} = g(x_i)
$$

To find $g'(r)$, first differentiate $g(x)$ with respect to $x$:

$$
g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} \right) = 1 - \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} \right)
$$

Using the **Quotient Rule** for differentiation:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} \right) = \frac{f'(x)f'(x) - f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2} = \frac{[f'(x)]^2 - f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2}
$$

Substituting back into the expression for $g'(x)$:

$$
g'(x) = 1 - \frac{[f'(x)]^2 - f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2} = 1 - 1 + \frac{f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2} = \frac{f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2}
$$

Given that $r$ is the root of $f(x)$:

$$
f(r) = 0
$$

Plugging $x = r$ into the derivative:

$$
g'(r) = \frac{f(r)f''(r)}{[f'(r)]^2} = \frac{0 \cdot f''(r)}{[f'(r)]^2} = 0
$$

Therefore:

$$
g'(r) = 0
$$

**This implies that convergence is guaranteed locally:**

_Theorem 1.6_ states that if $|g'(r)| < 1$, the Fixed-Point Iteration will converge to $r$, provided the initial guess $x_0$ is sufficiently close to $r$. Since $g'(r) = 0$, this condition is satisfied with $|g'(r)| = 0 < 1$. Thus, Newton’s Method will converge to the root $r$ if the initial guess is close enough.

## **2. First two terms of the Taylor series for $f(r)$:**

To complete our proof, we need to show that

$$
\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \left| \frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)} \right|
$$

Begin by writing out the first **two** terms of the Taylor series for $f(r)$ centered at $x_i$, along with the remainder term (see p. 21, with $x = r$, $x_0 = x_i$, and $c = c_i$).

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## **Answer**

The Taylor series expansion of a function $f(x)$ around a point $x_i$ up to the second term is given by:

$$
f(r) = f(x_i) + f'(x_i)(r - x_i) + \frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2
$$

Here:

- $x_i$ is the current approximation.
- $c_i$ is a point between $x_i$ and $r$.

## **3. Manipulate result:**

Manipulate your result so it looks like this _(note: the LHS of this equation is the RHS of Newton’s Method)_:

$$
x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = r + \frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2
$$

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## **Answer**

From the Taylor series expansion of $f(r)$ centered at $x_i$, we have:

$$
f(r) = f(x_i) + f'(x_i)(r - x_i) + \frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2
$$

Since $r$ is the root of $f(x)$, $f(r) = 0$. Substitute $f(r) = 0$:

$$
0 = f(x_i) + f'(x_i)(r - x_i) + \frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2
$$

Rearrange to solve for $f(x_i)$:

$$
f(x_i) = -f'(x_i)(r - x_i) - \frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2
$$

The formula for Newton’s Method is:

$$
x_{i+1} = x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}
$$

Substitute $f(x_i) = -f'(x_i)(r - x_i) - \frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2$ into $x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}$:

$$
x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = x_i - \frac{-f'(x_i)(r - x_i) - \frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2}{f'(x_i)}
$$

Break this into two terms:

- The first term:

  $$
  -\frac{-f'(x_i)(r - x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = r - x_i
  $$

- The second term:
  $$
  -\frac{\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2}{f'(x_i)} = \frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2
  $$

Combine the terms:

$$
x_i - \frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = r + \frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2
$$
